  Create a cinematic video shot using reference assets for continuity.

  Subject: {{subject}}.
  Action: {{action}}.
  Environment: {{environment}}.
  Camera plan: {{cameraPlan}}.
  Lighting plan: {{lightingPlan}}.
  Continuity lock: {{continuityLock}}.
  Duration: {{durationSeconds}} seconds.
  Aspect ratio: {{aspectRatio}}.

  Keep one primary subject and coherent body motion.
  Avoid duplicate faces, anatomy artifacts, unreadable text, and abrupt style shifts.
