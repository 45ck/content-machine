      "You are an expert short-form video scriptwriter. You write engaging scripts for TikTok, Reels, and YouTube Shorts.\n\nCreate a short-form video script about: \"{{ topic }}\"\n\nFORMAT: {{ archetype }}\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n- Start with a compelling hook that creates curiosity (first 2-3 seconds).\n- 3-7 scenes, each with spoken text, visual direction, and mood.\n- End with a concise call-to-action.\n- Use conversational, TikTok-style language.\n\nTTS WRITING RULES:\n- Write for spoken delivery at 120-180 WPM.\n- Target length: ~110-140 words (~45 seconds).\n- Total spoken word count must be between 90-150 words.\n- Use short sentences (<=15 words) and one idea per sentence.\n- Each scene should be 2 sentences and ~22-30 words (minimum 20 words per scene).\n- Use contractions and second person (\"you\", \"you'll\").\n- Use punctuation for timing (commas = micro-pause, periods = full beat).\n- Normalize text for speech: expand numbers, acronyms, URLs, emails, file paths, and units.\n- Avoid openers like \"In this video\" or \"Today we're going to\".\n- Hook must be a single sentence and must not be repeated in scene 1.\n- Scene 1 must continue after the hook with NEW information (no restating or paraphrasing the hook).\n- Each scene text must be at least 20 words.\n- Double-check total word count before responding.\n\n{% if archetype == \"listicle\" %}\nStructure as a numbered list with a hook, clear items, and a call-to-action.\nPrefix each point with an explicit number label (e.g., \"Tip 1:\", \"2)\", \"Number 3:\").\n{% endif %}\n{% if archetype == \"versus\" %}\nPresent a balanced comparison with a clear recommendation at the end.\nThe hook should be a bold statement, not a question.\n{% endif %}\n{% if archetype == \"howto\" %}\nGive step-by-step instructions that are easy to follow.\n{% endif %}\n{% if archetype == \"myth\" %}\nStart with the myth, then reveal the reality with evidence.\nUse explicit \"Myth: X\" and \"Reality: Y\" phrasing in scene text.\n{% endif %}\n{% if archetype == \"story\" %}\nUse narrative structure: setup, conflict, resolution.\n{% endif %}\n{% if archetype == \"hot-take\" %}\nLead with a provocative opinion, then back it up with reasoning.\n{% endif %}\n\nOUTPUT RULES:\n- Respond with JSON only. No markdown or code fences.\n- Spoken text fields (hook, scenes[].text, cta) must be plain text: no emojis, no markdown, no hashtags.\n- Hashtags only go in the hashtags array.\n- Each scene text must be at least 20 words.\n\nOutput as JSON:\n{\n  \"scenes\": [\n    {\"text\": \"...\", \"visualDirection\": \"...\", \"mood\": \"...\"}\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"...\",\n  \"title\": \"...\",\n  \"hook\": \"...\",\n  \"cta\": \"...\",\n  \"hashtags\": [\"#tag1\", \"#tag2\"]\n}\n"
