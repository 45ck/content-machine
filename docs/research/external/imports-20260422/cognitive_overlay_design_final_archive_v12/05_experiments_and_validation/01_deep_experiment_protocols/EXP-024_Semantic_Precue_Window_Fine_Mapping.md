# EXP-024 — Semantic Precue Window Fine Mapping

## Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Priority | P1 |
| Phase | Pilot second |
| Linked methods | PSP, SLSB, PCC |
| Source IDs | S03, S06, S22 |

## Purpose

Refine the best predictive semantic timing window after EXP-005.

## Mechanism bundle

- Predictive Semantic Priming
- Temporal Contiguity
- Mismatch Avoidance

## Why this experiment exists

This experiment converts a design assumption into a falsifiable comparison. It should be run before promoting any related method into production defaults. The goal is not to make a style look good; the goal is to determine whether the method improves the metric that its mechanism predicts.

## Conditions

| Code | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| PRE600 | 600 ms before. |
| PRE400 | 400 ms before. |
| PRE250 | 250 ms before. |
| PRE100 | 100 ms before. |
| SYNC | on beat. |
| POST250 | 250 ms after. |

## Falsifiable hypotheses

- H1: the optimal window will be close to PRE100–PRE250 or SYNC.
- H2: PRE600 produces mismatch/spoiler effect.
- H3: optimal timing differs by speech rate.

## Primary metric

Gist recall + smoothness rating.

## Secondary metrics

Mismatch reports, effort, preference, speech-text integration.

## Sample and participants

Pilot n=50; validation n=150.

Participant notes:

- Test on mobile-sized playback whenever possible.
- Record whether participants watched audio-on or muted.
- Record native language / L2 status where relevant.
- Record prior familiarity with the content domain where relevant.
- Exclude trials where participants did not actually view enough of the video to answer.

## Study design

Timing fine-mapping design controlling for caption duration.

Design requirements:

1. Hold source footage constant across conditions.
2. Change only the target overlay variable unless the experiment explicitly tests a package such as BCC+.
3. Counterbalance order to avoid fatigue/order effects.
4. Prevent participants from seeing the same script in multiple overlay conditions unless the experiment explicitly tests repeated exposure.
5. Keep full accessibility captions available where accessibility is not the manipulated variable.

## Stimulus requirements

Clips with slow, medium, and fast speech rates.

Each stimulus should have:

- exact transcript;
- semantic beat sheet;
- overlay condition file;
- placement map;
- visual-load label;
- video-type label;
- expected gist answer;
- expected action/takeaway answer;
- exact-recall question;
- visual-recall question.

## Procedure

1. Consent / instructions.
2. Device check: mobile or mobile-sized player.
3. Randomized exposure to assigned videos.
4. Immediate recall questions after each clip.
5. Effort/clarity/obstruction rating after each clip.
6. Preference comparison at end if participant has seen multiple styles.
7. Optional delayed recall follow-up for memory experiments.
8. Optional eye-tracking or webcam-gaze capture if available.

## Data fields

| Field | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| participant_id | Anonymous participant identifier. |
| video_id | Stimulus identifier. |
| condition_code | Overlay condition assigned. |
| viewing_mode | Audio-on, muted, or platform-native. |
| video_type | Talking head, demo, tutorial, emotional story, etc. |
| visual_load | Low, medium, high or numeric frame-load score. |
| gist_recall | Main-point score, 0/1 or percentage. |
| action_recall | Action/takeaway score. |
| exact_recall | Exact wording/details score. |
| visual_recall | Scene/object/action recall score. |
| perceived_effort | Likert rating, e.g. 1–7. |
| clarity | Likert rating. |
| obstruction | Likert or coded complaint. |
| preference | Chosen preferred variant. |
| completion | Whether video was completed. |
| watch_time | Seconds watched. |
| notes | Qualitative observations. |

## Analysis plan

Timing offset × speech rate model.

Recommended model:

```text
outcome ~ condition + video_type + viewing_mode + visual_load + condition:video_type + (1|participant_id) + (1|video_id)
```

For binary recall outcomes, use logistic mixed-effects models. For Likert outcomes, use ordinal or linear mixed models depending on measurement design. For platform tests, compare practical uplift against predetermined metrics rather than relying on raw statistical significance alone.

## Planned contrasts

Declare planned contrasts before running the study.

General contrasts:

- Target method vs its baseline.
- Target method vs negative control.
- Target method vs simpler lower-cost method.
- Segment-specific comparison by video type and viewing mode.

## Pass rule

Adopt the window that maximizes recall and smoothness with low mismatch.

## Fail / demotion rule

If no pre-cue advantage, standardize sync-locked semantic beats.

## Guardrails

A condition cannot be accepted if it:

- worsens accessibility;
- meaningfully reduces visual recall when visual information matters;
- increases confusion comments or distortion errors;
- improves watch time only by making the content harder to understand;
- obscures mouth, eyes, hands, product, action, captions, or platform UI in a content-relevant way.

## Interpretation guide

| Result pattern | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| Target beats baseline on primary metric and guardrails hold | Promote or move to larger validation. |
| Target improves watch time but harms recall | Reject for educational/comprehension use. |
| Target equals baseline but is simpler/faster to produce | Consider operational adoption only if no quality regression. |
| Target only works in one segment | Route by context; do not globalize. |
| Negative control performs well | Check task, metrics, and stimulus validity. |

## Production implication

If this experiment passes, update the routing rules and production checklist. If it fails, demote the method, restrict it to a segment, or revise the mechanism.
