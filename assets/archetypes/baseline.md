## Baseline rules (apply to every archetype)

- Put the hook immediately (first 1-3 seconds), then deliver on it quickly. (TikTok For Business: creative best practices) [1]
- Use captions / text overlays. Keep on-screen text readable; TikTok guidance is roughly 5-10 words/sec for on-screen text. [1]
- Keep visuals moving with jump cuts, overlays, transitions, stickers/graphics. [1]
- Add subtle motion (punch-ins / pans / Ken Burns) using keyframes (position/scale/rotation/opacity). (CapCut keyframes guide) [2]
