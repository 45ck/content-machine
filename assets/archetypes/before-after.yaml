    FORMAT: Before / After
    Typical length: 10-25s

    REQUIREMENTS:
    - Show AFTER first as a pattern interrupt.
    - Flash BEFORE quickly so contrast lands.
    - Explain 2-3 labeled changes (e.g. "Change #1: ...").
    - Keep before/after comparable (same framing/angle/format).

    STRUCTURE:
    1) Hook field: show AFTER immediately (one sentence spoken hook)
    2) Scene 1: flash BEFORE and name the gap
    3) Scene 2-4: changes (2-3)
    4) Final scene: final AFTER + CTA

    TIMELINE (18s template):
    - 0-2s: AFTER
    - 2-4s: BEFORE
    - 4-14s: 3 changes (about 3s each)
    - 14-18s: AFTER + CTA ("Want the exact settings? comment 'AFTER'.")
