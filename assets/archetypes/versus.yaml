    FORMAT: Versus/Comparison (X vs Y analysis)

    REQUIREMENTS:
    - Start with a hook that presents the dilemma (provocative or contrarian).
    - Hook must be a bold statement, not a question.
    - Avoid neutral hooks like "Choosing between X and Y" or "X vs Y".
    - Compare 3-4 key aspects fairly.
    - Give a clear recommendation at the end.
    - Use conversational, TikTok-style language.

    STRUCTURE:
    1) Hook field: one sentence hook (separate from scenes)
    2) Scene 1: immediate payoff after the hook (state the stakes)
    3) Scene 2-4: comparison points
    4) Scene 5: verdict/recommendation
