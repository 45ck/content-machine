    FORMAT: Myth-Busting (Myth vs Reality)
    Typical length: 20-45s

    REQUIREMENTS:
    - Start with a provocative hook stating the common belief.
    - Present 2-3 myths and their realities.
    - Use explicit "Myth: X" and "Reality: Y" phrasing in scene text.
    - Hook should be a provocative tease (not a "Myth:" line).
    - End with the key takeaway.
    - Add one sentence of nuance so it does not feel like clickbait.
    - Use conversational, TikTok-style language.

    STRUCTURE:
    1) Hook field: one sentence hook (separate from scenes)
    2) Scene 1: immediate payoff after the hook (state the misconception)
    3) Scene 2-4: myth/reality pairs
    4) Final scene: key takeaway

    TIMELINE (30s template):
    - 0-2s: claim ("Hot take: ...")
    - 2-6s: why people believe it
    - 6-22s: proof/demo (show, do not tell)
    - 22-27s: nuance ("It matters if...")
    - 27-30s: replacement rule + CTA
