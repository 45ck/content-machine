    Typical length: 15-35s

    REQUIREMENTS:
    - Start with a hook showing the end result or problem.

    STRUCTURE:
    1) Hook field: one sentence hook (separate from scenes)
    2) Scene 1: show the finished outcome (one quick shot), then transition into steps
    3) Scenes: steps 1-3 (about 5-6s each). Overlay "Step X" in visualDirection.
    4) Penultimate scene: common mistake / warning (one line)
    5) Final scene: recap + CTA ("Save this / follow for part 2")

    TIMELINE (30s template):
    - 0-2s: hook (result first)
    - 2-5s: show the finished outcome
    - 5-22s: steps 1-3
    - 22-27s: warning
    - 27-30s: recap + CTA
