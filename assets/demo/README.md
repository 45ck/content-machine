# Demo Media

GitHub READMEs can’t inline-play `mp4` files, so this repo keeps small, README-friendly
assets here (SVGs, GIFs, and thumbnails) and links out to full videos.

## Recommended approach

- **Full demo video:** upload an `mp4` to a GitHub Release, YouTube, or Vimeo.
- **README preview:** add a small `gif` (or `webp`) here and link it to the full video.

## Size guidance

- Keep animated previews **small** (ideally <10MB) so the README loads quickly.
- Prefer **short loops** (5–15s), cropped to the most interesting moment.
