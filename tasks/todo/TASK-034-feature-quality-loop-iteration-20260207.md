## Feature Description

**Goal:** Connect score + lab + feedback into a repeatable iteration loop (hypothesis testing).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given two runs, when running the loop command, then it opens `cm lab compare` in one-shot mode and waits for submission.
- [ ] Given a submission, then it writes a structured experiment artifact and prints a short summary.
- [ ] Given the reviewer UI, then it does not show heuristic scores before ratings are submitted.
